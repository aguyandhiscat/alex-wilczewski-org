# Alex.Wilczewski.org

This repository contains the current site files for https://alex.wilczewski.org, the blog/portfolio site of developer Alex Wilczewski.

**Included in this repository:**

* WordPress core files
* Plugin files

**What's *not* included:**

* Database dump
* Uploaded media (/wp-content/uploads/)

## Cloning this repository

If you wish to run your own version of this WordPress installation you'll need to take a few extra steps beyond "clone and deploy":

1. Clone the git repo.
2. Try to visit your new WordPress installation. Since wp-config.php is missing, you should be shown the standard WordPress installation screen (as usual, if your system won't let WordPress create a wp-config file you'll need to copy wp-config-sample.php `cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php` and edit the file manually).
3. Once WordPress is setup, you'll need to activate the plugins and start creating your post/page structure.

## Roadmap

There are a ton of things left to do on the site, but it's being treated as a work in progress (a nice way of saying "moving target").

* Create personal theme
* Post an article
